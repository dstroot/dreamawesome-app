      Messages must be an array of message objects, where each object has a
      role (either “system”, “user”, or “assistant”) and content (the content
      of the message). Conversations can be as short as 1 message or fill many pages.

      Typically, a conversation is formatted with a system message first, followed 
      by alternating user and assistant messages.

      The user messages help instruct the assistant. They can be generated by 
      the end users of an application, or set by a developer as an instruction.

      The assistant messages help store prior responses. They can also be 
      written by a developer to help give examples of desired behavior.
